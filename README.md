Users are able to submit input to create a new animal button.

When a user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.

Under every gif, its rating is displayed.
